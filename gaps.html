        <h1>How the gaps were identified</h1>
        <h2>First gap</h2>
        <p>We started asking ChatGPT to find cultural properties related to Benozzo Gozzoli. Here is the question we made and the answer of the LLM:<br>
        <i>Can you make a SPARQL query on ArCo which can ask the following question: what are the cultural properties of the author Benozzo Gozzoli?</i><br>
        ChatGPT's answer:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span style="font-size: 80%;"><p>We need to find cultural properties (typically instances of arco-core:CulturalProperty) that are linked to the author Benozzo Gozzoli as their creator.
Here's a SPARQL query that does that:
<pre><code class="language-sparql">PREFIX arco-core: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/core/&gt;
PREFIX arco-cd: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/context-description/&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

SELECT DISTINCT ?culturalProperty ?title ?type
WHERE {
  ?culturalProperty a arco-core:CulturalProperty ;
                    arco-core:hasAgentRole ?agentRole .

  ?agentRole a arco-cd:Author ;
             arco-core:hasAgent ?author .

  ?author rdfs:label "Benozzo Gozzoli"@it .

  OPTIONAL { ?culturalProperty rdfs:label ?title . }

  OPTIONAL { ?culturalProperty a ?type . }
}</code></pre></span>

        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We tried this query on the SPARQL endpoint of ArCo <a href="https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql"> (OpenLink Virtuoso SPARQL Query Editor) </a>, it worked but it didn't give any result.<br>
          Therefore we said to the LLM:<br>
         <i>There are no results for this query on ArCo.</i><br>
          ChatGPT's answer:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span style="font-size: 80%;"><p>Thanks for checking - you're right, <strong>the query returns no results</strong> as written, likely because of one or more of the following issues: <br>
            1. <strong>Benozzo Gozzoli may not be labeled exactly as "Benozzo Gozzoli"@it</strong> in the ArCo dataset.<br>
            2. <strong>The author might be represented as a URI, not a literal label.</strong> <br>
            3. <strong>The role or relationship pattern could differ</strong>, i.e.,
          <span style="color:green;">arco-core:hasAgentRole</span>might not be the correct property path.</p>
           <p>Let me refine the approach by <strong>searching for the actual URI</strong> of Benozzo gozzoli and adjusting the structure accordingly.</p> 
        <h4>Step-by-step fixed query:</h4>
        <strong>First,</strong> try to find the URI for Benozzo Gozzoli in ArCo:<br>
  <pre>?culturalProperty a arco-core:CulturalProperty ;
                    arco-core:hasAgentRole ?agentRole .

  ?agentRole a arco-cd:Author ;
             arco-core:hasAgent ?author .</pre>
<pre><code class="language-sparql">
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person rdfs:label ?label .
  FILTER (LANG(?label) = "it" && CONTAINS(LCASE(?label), "benozzo gozzoli"))
}
          </code></pre>
This query searches for any resource whose label includes "benozzo gozzoli" (case-insensitive, Italian).
</blockquote></p></span>
<p>This query finds results, but they are only resources related to the low case string “benozzo gozzoli”.
  We needed to find results related to the label “benozzo gozzoli” regardless of the character, so we asked ChatGPT
  to rewrite the query with the case insensitive symbol “i” instead of LCASE in the FILTER part. This is its answer:</p>
<p><blockquote>
  <span style="font-size: 80%;"><pre><code class="language-sparql">
  PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person rdfs:label ?label .
  FILTER (LANG(?label) = "it" && REGEX(?label, "benozzo gozzoli", "i"))
}</>code></pre>
</blockquote></p> </span>  
<p>We were able to find more results.
</p>
<img src="img/case insensitive results.png" alt="Case insensitive research results">
<p>ChatGPT's answer continued like this:</p>
        <span style="font-size: 80%;"><blockquote><strong>If we get a URI like:</strong>
<pre><code class="language-sparql">&lt;http://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview/agent/BenozzoGozzoli&gt;
We would plug it into this query to find associated cultural properties:
PREFIX arco-core: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/core/&gt;
PREFIX arco-cd: &lt;https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/context-description/&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

SELECT DISTINCT ?culturalProperty ?title ?type
WHERE {
  ?culturalProperty a arco-core:CulturalProperty ;
                    arco-core:hasAgentRole ?agentRole .

  ?agentRole a arco-cd:Author ;
             arco-core:hasAgent &lt;http://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview/agent/BenozzoGozzoli&gt; .

  OPTIONAL { ?culturalProperty rdfs:label ?title . }
  OPTIONAL { ?culturalProperty a ?type . }
              }</pre></code>
  Would you like me to look up the <strong>actual URI for Benozzo Gozzoli</strong> in the ArCo dataset for you now?
 </blockquote></span>
<p>This last query doesn’t provide any result because ChatGPT made up the URI for Benozzo Gozzoli. We asked ChatGPT to search for a URI. We found the URI and the solution can be seen on the section <a href="https://alicesgarlata.github.io/gozzoli-project/challenges.html">Challenges</a>.
This was ChatGPT's answer:</p>
<span style="font-size: 80%;"><blockquote>Thank you for your patience. Upon investigation, it appears that the ArCo dataset does not contain entries for Benozzo Gozzoli or his works. This absence likely explains why the previous SPARQL queries returned no results.
However, Benozzo Gozzoli's artworks are well-documented in other cultural heritage datasets, such as Wikidata. For instance, his renowned fresco cycle in the Magi Chapel at Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence is cataloged there.
To retrieve information about cultural properties associated with Benozzo Gozzoli from Wikidata, you can use the following SPARQL query:
<pre><code>PREFIX wd: &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/&gt;
PREFIX wdt: &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

SELECT DISTINCT ?work ?workLabel ?locationLabel ?inception
WHERE {
  ?work wdt:P170 wd:Q55919.  # Benozzo Gozzoli's Wikidata ID
  OPTIONAL { ?work wdt:P276 ?location. }
  OPTIONAL { ?work wdt:P571 ?inception. }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
ORDER BY ?inception</code></pre>
  This query retrieves works created by Benozzo Gozzoli, along with their labels, locations, and inception dates, if available.
You can execute this query on the <a href="https://query.wikidata.org"/>Wikidata Query Service.</a>
If you need assistance in adapting this query for other datasets or require further information, feel free to ask.
</blockquote></span>
<p>ChatGPT suggested using Wikidata, another knowledge graph, but it is not part of our project therefore we avoided it. <mark>Overall, the request to ChatGPT to find the URI of Benozzo Gozzoli led to no results</mark>, so we decided to search for the URI in a different way, which will be addressed in the <a href="https://alicesgarlata.github.io/gozzoli-project/challenges.html">Challenges page</a>. 
We still thought that it was a good idea to insert this answer by ChatGPT because it shows how this LLM reasons.</p>

<h2>Second gap</h2>
  <h3><i>Can you open the Benozzo Gozzoli's DBpedia page?

  <h3><i>Can you open the Benozzo Gozzoli's DBpedia page?
  <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Benozzo_Gozzoli">https://dbpedia.org/page/Benozzo_Gozzoli</a></i></h3>
  <h4>Gemini answer:</h4>
  <span style="font-size: 80%;"><p>
I cannot directly "open" a web page in the way a web browser does. As a text-based AI, I don't have a graphical user interface or the ability to navigate the web interactively.
However, I can confirm that the link you provided, <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Benozzo_Gozzoli">https://dbpedia.org/page/Benozzo_Gozzoli</a>, is the correct URL for the DBpedia page about Benozzo Gozzoli.
If you would like me to extract specific information from that page, or analyze its content, please let me know! You would need to provide me with the text content if you want me to process it, as I cannot browse the internet in real-time.</span>
During our research we checked Michelangelo’s DBpedia page and we noticed that while he has a dbo:author property that connects him to some of his works, on Benozzo Gozzoli’s page there is no dbo:author property connecting his artworks.
This is a triple that can potentially create a dbo:author property for Benozzo Gozzoli. We checked it on an RDF validator.
<span style="font-size: 80%;"><pre><code class="language-xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

</code></pre></span>
              
<h2>Third Gap</h2>
               <p>At this point we chose some artworks by Benozzo Gozzoli and asked ChatGPT if they were available on DBpedia.
This was our first question, using a <mark>few shot prompting</mark>:
              <i>Can you see on the SPARQL endpoint of DBpedia (https://dbpedia.org/sparql) if these artworks by Benozzo Gozzoli are 
                present on DBpedia? Also see if their name is in the English translation. Do not consider Wikidata in your answer. These are the Italian titles of the artworks:<br>
- L’adorazione dei Magi (Adoration of the Magi)<br>
- Cristo in pietà tra la Vergine e San Giovanni (Christ the Man of Sorrows between the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist)<br>
- Incendio di Sodoma, distruzione di Sodoma e Gomorra (The burning of sodom)<br>
- L’ubriachezza di Noè, l'ebbrezza di Noè (The Vintage and Drunkenness of Noah)<br>
While you answer this question, follow this pattern:<br>
Title of the artwork: Purification of the Virgin<br>
Present on DBpedia: Yes<br>
Image present under property foaf:depiction: No<br>
</i>
               ChatGPT's answer:
              <span style="font-size: 80%;"><blockquote>Here are the results of the SPARQL check on DBpedia for each of the listed artworks by Benozzo Gozzoli 
                 (checking for English‑labelled entries only, excluding Wikidata):
                 <strong>L'adorazione dei Magi (Adoration of the Magi)
                 Present on DBpedia:</strong>Yes — the broader subject Adoration of the Magi is present and linked within Benozzo Gozzoli’s page <a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Benozzo_Gozzoli?utm_source=chatgpt.com">en.wikipedia.org+6dbpedia.org+6it.wikipedia.org+6</a>.
                 <strong>Image present under property "foaf:depiction"</strong>: No — there is no specific depiction tied to a DBpedia resource for Gozzoli's Adoration of the Magi, only general depictions associated with the artist himself. 
</blockquote>
               <p>The specific artwork is actually not available on DBpedia, there is only the page for the “Procession of the Magi” and also the biblical theme of the Adoration of the Magi. So we can enrich DBpedia also with this artwork. </p>
               <blockquote><strong>Cristo in pietà tra la Vergine e San Giovanni (Christ the Man of Sorrows between the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist)
               Present on DBpedia:</strong>No — a SPARQL search and page browse did not produce any specific DBpedia resource or English‑labelled entry for this title under Gozzoli.
               <strong>Image present under property "foaf:depiction"</strong>: N/A (since the artwork itself isn0t present).
               <br>
               <strong>Incendio di Sodoma, distruzione di Sodoma e Gomorra (The burning of Sodom)
               Present on DBpedia:</strong>No — no DBpedia entry or mention for this work by Gozzoli was found.
               <strong>Image present under property "foaf:depiction"</strong>: N/A.
               <br>
               <strong>L’ubriachezza di Noè, l'ebbrezza di Noè (The Vintage and Drunkenness of Noah)
 Present on DBpedia:</strong>No — likewise, no matching DBpedia resource or English‑labelled title exists for this painting.
               <strong> Image present under property "foaf:depiction":</strong> N/A.</blockquote></span>
               <p>We also checked manually if these artworks are actually missing on DBpedia. We used these four artworks to create RDF triples which can be used to enrich DBpedia.

On Benozzo Gozzoli’s DBpedia page there are some resources whose name seem to refer to the artist’s artworks, but they are actually cultural/biblical themes, they are not connected Gozzoli with the property dbo:Author.
</p>
<h2>Fourth Gap</h2>
<p>Later during the project, we found another gap on DBpedia compared to ArCo, which was <strong>missing information in the italian biography of Benozzo Gozzoli on DBpedia.</strong> Indeed, the Dutch version of his biography presented much more information than the Italian one, consisting of a brief description. Since he is an italian artist, we thought it would be ideal to enrich his biography in the italian language. The methodology to do so will be further explained in the “Challenges” section since in doing so, we faced a peculiar problem.</p>
