# Benozzo Gozzoli - Knowledge Engineering for the Humanities Group Project

This project explores and enriches the semantic representation of the Italian Renaissance painter Benozzo Gozzoli using RDF and SPARQL. It was developed as part of an academic assignment focused on Linked Open Data for cultural heritage.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Collect and represent artworks attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli using RDF.
- Integrate and align data from existing knowledge graphs (DBpedia, ArCo).
- Identify gaps in existing data and propose enrichment strategies (e.g. missing museum locations, missing portraits information like images, year of production and its description in Italian and English).
- Publish the results as a static website via GitHub Pages.
