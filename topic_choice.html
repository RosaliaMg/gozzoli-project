        <h1>Topic Choice</h1>
        <p>When selecting the topic, we were interested in researching minor artists who had little to no information on the analyzed knowledge graphs, namely ArCo and DBpedia.
          In particular, we focused on the Renaissance artist <strong>Benozzo Gozzoli</strong> and his works.
          <br>
        Benozzo Gozzoli, also known as Benozzo di Lese di Sandro, was an italian artist. He painted several artworks, however most of them are not well known nor well documented. We chose this topic because one of us is familiar with the Museum of Benozzo Gozzoli in Castelfiorentino, in the province of Florence, and is aware that this artist is mostly unknown by the common public, compared to other Renaissance artists, even if he created numerous relevant artworks, which are spread across Tuscany and in other regions of Italy.
</p>
        <h2>Our aim</h2>
        <p>At first, the goal was to compare ArCo and DBpedia knowledge graphs, to see which artworks by Benozzo Gozzoli are available on ArCo but not on DBpedia,
           in order to enrich DBpedia with the triples of the missing artworks. During the research we also noticed that some biographical information was poor or
        completely missing on the DBpedia page of Benozzo Gozzoli, for this reason we also decided to enrich this part with RDF triples.</p>
